# Example Environment Configuration for Frontend

# API Base URL
# In development, this is typically handled by vite.config.ts proxy (e.g., http://localhost:5000)
# In production, set this to the full URL of your backend if it's on a different domain
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1

# If serving via Nginx on the same domain, you can leave this empty or use relative path '/api/v1'
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api/v1
